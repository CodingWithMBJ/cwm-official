        I’m a fullstack developer focused on building practical, real-world
        applications. I like working end-to-end: designing the UI, wiring up the
        frontend, and connecting it to reliable backend services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I’ve been spending most of my time with React, Node.js, and
        modern tooling like Vite and Tailwind CSS. I’m always improving my
        fundamentals and shipping projects that teach me something new.
